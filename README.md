# Restaurant Details
To find the available restaurant details


# Challenge Description:

1. You have the following API endpoint:
https://postman-echo.com/get?foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2
Please set up a quick page using any language. Call the API endpoint
and display results

2. Given the attached CSV data file - [rest_open_hours.csv](https://github.com/Lawrencesoft/RestaurantDetails/blob/main/rest_open_hours.csv) </br>
a. Write a function that parses the data into a table</br>
b. Write a function that receives a date object native to your
language of choice and uses a sql query to return a list of
restaurant names which are open on that date and time.

Assumptions:
* If a day of the week is not listed, the restaurant is closed on
that day
* All times are local — don’t worry about timezone-awareness
* The CSV file will be well-formed
Optimized solutions are nice, but correct
So, I have a friend called Frank. He owns a second hand car garage and needs your help!
He would like you to create a website for his shop. These days Frank only sells his second hand cars online and could use a website of his own. With that said I guess we should do this in phases, because you know...agile! So it would be best if you start with Phase1!
